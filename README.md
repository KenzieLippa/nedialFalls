This is the start of my game containing hand drawn assets that took many hours to complete. I am excited to update this to GD 4.3 and have been working on character portraits and a time system.
These assets are just rough for now and will be shaded and fixed later on
These art assets are copywritten by me so please do not use them, this is only public for portfolio reasons.
